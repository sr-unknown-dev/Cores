<h1>What's New in 2024.3.2
    This minor update brings out-of-the-box IDE support for .env files and environment variables, as well as an Explain with AI action for errors in log files.


    .env file support
    Support for .env files was previously available via a plugin, but PhpStorm 2024.3.2 now bundles it right in the IDE, meaning you can use it without installing anything additional. The support includes:

    Syntax highlighting and validation inspections in .env files.
    Navigation between environment variable declarations and usages.

    Code completion for environment variable keys
    PhpStorm 2024.3.2 helps you manage app configs stored in environment variables, providing code completion for the defined variable keys. Environment variable keys are fetched from the .env file, Dockerfile, or docker-compose.yml file.

    To invoke code completion, start typing the variable key name or press ⌃Ctrl + Space.

    AI explanations for log errors
    JetBrains AI Assistant in PhpStorm can now help you understand and fix errors in log files. Use Explain with AI to open the AI chat and automatically send the prompt. You can then customize the prompt’s context or change the LLM used.</h1>
